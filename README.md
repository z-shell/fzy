[Zinit](https://github.com/z-shell/zinit) can use the NPM package registry to automatically:

- get the plugin's Git repository OR release-package URL,
- get the list of the recommended ices for the plugin,
  - there can be multiple lists of ices,
  - the ice lists are stored in *profiles*; there's at least one profile, *default*,
  - the ices can be selectively overriden.

Example invocations that'll install
[jhawthorn/fzy](https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy) either from the release
archive or from Git repository:

```zsh
# Download the package with the default ice list
zinit pack for fzy

# Download the package with the bin-gem-node annex-utilizing ice list
zinit pack"bgn" for fzy

# Download with the bin-gem-node annex-utilizing ice list FROM GIT REPOSITORY
zinit pack"bgn" git for fzy

# Download normal ice list and override atclone'' ice to skip the contrib scripts
zinit pack"bgn" atclone'' for fzy
```

## Default Profile

Provides the fuzzy finder via Makefile-installation of the `fzy` binary under
`$ZPFX/bin`.

```zsh
zinit lucid as"program" pick"$ZPFX/bin/fzy*" \
    atclone"cp contrib/fzy-* $ZPFX/bin" \
    make"PREFIX=$ZPFX install" \
    …
```

## Bin-Gem-Node Profile

Provides the fuzzy finder via *shims*, i.e.: automatic forwarder scripts created
under `$ZPFX/bin` (which is added to the `$PATH` by default). It needs the
[bin-gem-node](https://github.com/z-shell/z-a-bin-gem-node) annex.

```zsh
zinit lucid as"null" make sbin"fzy;contrib/fzy-*" …
```
